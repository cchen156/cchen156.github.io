      "question": "Can I customize what JuxtaposeJS looks like?",
      "answer": "<p>In it's simplest form, JuxtaposeJS is embedded using an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag. In this form, there's no way to customize the appearance.</p><p> If you are comfortable integrating markup and javascript into your own page, you can go beyond the  <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. JuxtaposeJS is designed with a minimalist style meant to work with most websites. If you want to customize the appearance, you can change most of how it looks with CSS rules.
